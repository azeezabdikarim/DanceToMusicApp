# Dance to Music

## Introduction
Welcome to DanceToMusic, an innovative project that blends my interest in computer vison, audio digital signal processing and generative AI to create novel music based on a sequence of human poses. In its current state, this model takes in a 5 sec video, and returns a 5 second piece of generated audio that corresponds with the movementâ€™s of the dancer in the video. 

## Motivation
Inspired by the recent 'text-to-image' (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion) and 'text-to-music' models (MusicLM, MusicGen), this project aims to develop 'Dance-to-Music'. Dance to Music is a technology that could have applicability in the world of social media or content creation, by allowing users to add custom music to their dance videos. Currently this model generates music based off the movements of a single subject in the video, however I can see it being easily extended to generate music conditioned on the movement of multiple subjects in a video. Now imagine if one were to install a camera inside a nightclub, and instead of there being a DJ, trust DanceToMusic to generate music in real-time, that is corresponding the movements of everyone in the club, what would that sound like?

## Installation
One can start playing with this project by first cloning the repository, building the dataset, and then running the training script. 
```bash

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/azeezabdikarim/DanceToMusic.git

# Navigate to the repository
cd DanceToMusic

# It is recommended to create a virtual environment for the project to avoid conflicts with other packages and versions
python -m .venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows, use `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
# On Unix or MacOS, use `source venv/bin/activate`
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build the video dataset, extracting 5 second clips at 24fps
# FYI: The video downloads might take a while depending on your internet speeds. Also, MediaPipe uses the CPU to calculate human pose estimates, so that will take a decent amount of time. It takes me between 1-2 hours to build the complete dataset of ~1300 clips on a MacBook Pro with an M2 Max chip
python ml/data/building_tools/build_dnb_dataset.py --output_path ml/data/samples/ --input_csv ml/data/youtube_links/youtube_links_test.csv  --max_seq_len 5 --fps 24

# If you want to test the model's generative capabilties, you can navigate to the webapp/ directory and run app.py, which launches a local Flask webapp where one can upload a video, and in turn receive generated music.
# Depending on the local machine's computing resources, human pose estimation and audio generation could take 3-20 seconds. Once a video is uploaded the page will hold and run computation until the new audio is ready.
pip install Flask
cd webapp/
python app.py

```
## Usage

## EnCodec Model
The EnCodec model is a state-of-the-art high fidelity audio encoder developed by the FAIR team at Meta. The model follows an encoder-decoder type of architecture with the latent space represented by a residual vector quantized latent space. The model is trained with perceptual loss where the generated samples were judged by a discriminator, to reduce artifacts and generate high quality samples. 

Adding a vector quantized codebook to an autoencoder architecture, such as the EnCodec model, enables a discrete representation of the latent space, which can be advantageous for handling complex data distributions and improving the robustness of the model against small input variations. This discretization also facilitates the learning of a more meaningful and structured latent space, which can be beneficial for downstream tasks like generation or retrieval.

When the codebook is extended to a Residual Vector Quantized (RVQ) Codebook, the model gains the ability to capture finer details by representing residuals or differences between the input and the current reconstruction at each stage. This layered approach of quantization allows the model to iteratively refine its output, leading to a more precise and higher fidelity reconstruction than what could be achieved with a standard Vector Quantized Codebook.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this projects is a personally aggregated set of dance videos paired with their corresponding music. Each dance clip is processed using MediaPipe's 3D human pose estimation model. Only one human is selected per video clip, for which the model generates a set of 33x3 key points per frame. Videos are standardized in the training set to last 5 sec at 24fps, resulting in a sequence of 120 frames per sample. The final dimensions for an individual sample are therefore 120x33x3.

For each dancing clip, I extracted the audio as a .wav file. Spleeter, and audio source seperation tool made by Deezer is used to extract the drum and base from each song, which are then combined to create a Drum and Bass version of each track. I use the '24khz' encoder of the EnCodec audio encoder, to the map the 5 second drum and base audio clip to a lower dimensionality latent space. For a 5 second clip, the EnCodec model produces a latent vector of 2x377, which is then flattened to 1x754, and use as the target in the training dataset.

## Model Architecture 
![Model Architecture for Training and Inference](ml/assets/model_archtiecture.png "Model Architecture for training and inference")
From a high-level point of view, the goal of this project is to produce a sequence-to-sequence model capable of mapping a sequence of 33x3 human pose key points to a latent vector, which represents a sequence of codebook values. One of the advantages of using the audio codes generated by the EnCodec model for our target is the fact that the latent space is represented by a sequence of discrete values from a codebook, meaning the model only needs to learn to predict values of a fixed vocabulary. In the case of the '24khz' EnCodec model, the length of the codebook is 1024. In comparison to the text based tasks where the vocabulary can be thousands of distinct values, 1024 values is a relatively small vocabulary, which increases the chances for success.

In the context of our training dataset of 5 sec clips filmed at 24fps with an audio sample rate of 24khz, our goals is to map a vector sequence of 120x33x3 to a latent audio code sequence of 1x754. Due to the layered approach of quantization in a RVQ codebook, our sequence-to-sequence model most reconstruct the audio codes autoregressively. 

## Training
The PoseToMusic transformer is trained to encode the sequence of human pose estimates, and with this context the decoder is tasked autoregressively predicts the sequence of codebook values that matches the target, which is EnCodec's encoding of the audio file. Training is conducted using a 85%-15% training and validation split which accounts for (~2000 training and ~350 validation samples).

The autoregressive nature of the model means that the decoder generates new values for the sequence based on the previous values it has already generated. This type of training can take a while to converge due to the fact that the decoder can compound mistakes, which is why I implemented teacher-forcing 50% of the time. With teacher forcing, previous correct values from the target are provided to the decoder, which in turn helps it converge faster. 

Given the fact that codebook values are discrete, and not sequentially related to one another (eg. Codebook index 1 is not necessarily closer to index 2 than it is to index 55), each codebook value is treated like a class label. For each newly generated token the decoder outputs a softmax vector equal in length to the length of the codebook. The argmax of this vector is taken, and the result is filled in as the next token of the sequence. 

Each generated sequence of audio codes is compared to the target and scored using NLLoss. We train to minimize NLLoss, and as it declines, DanceToMusic learns to generate more realistic music. 

Training stops once the validation loss platues, as I want to avoid overfitting to the training data.

## Results
Sample results can be viewed below by clicking on the thumbnails. In the models current state we can see that the results are not yet ideal. The audio generated has the hints of musicality, however it doesn't come close to obviously matching the movement of the dancer.

## Next Steps
I have a few theories for why the model struggles to produce suitable music to match the subjects movements. To improve the generative abilities I am looking into improving the model archtiecture, as well as improving the training dataset.

#### Improve Model Architecture 
Currently NLLLoss is used ot train the model and it is calculaed by comparing the audio encoding of the training data with the encoding tensor produced by the Pose2AudioTransformer. While this is a cocneptually solid strategy, it forces the model to learn a direct mapping to the EncCodec models latent space, whcih is not fully understood. It is unclear how minor changes in an audio encoding effects the generated audio. 
A new strategy that I am investigating is to train the model using a perceptual loss. This will be calcualted by taking the output from the Pose2AudioTransformer, and decoding it using EnCodec's decoder. I plan to compare the mel spectrogram of the generated sample with the mel spectrgoram of the training audio sample. Ideally this will give the Pose2AudioTransformer more flexibility since it's goal will no longer be to perfectly replciate the audio encoding of the EnCodec model, but rather to produce encoding values that once generated sound as similar as possble to real training data.

#### Improve the Training Data
- Currently there are roughly 1,300 5sec training samples. I am working to increase the size of the training set to 10,000+ samples. 
- The human pose estimation isn't perfect. In some samples, there are momentary glitches in the keypoint detection, which may be having more impact than is trully understood. Manualy cleaning fo this dataset would be tedious, so I am looking into strategies of automatically identifying samples where the pose estimation performs poorly.
